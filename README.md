  Using the windows scheduled job feature incorporated in Microsoft windows, we will be developing a web-based tool that allows the Company/Employee to easily access any discrepancies that may occur during job scheduling. The overall database will be stored in MySQL in the appropriate tables. Upon checking these tables, any missing/wrong information will be immediately added to the exceptions table, which can be viewed and downloaded for review or revision from the website.
